A "backend" in Terraform determines how state is loaded and how an operation such as apply is executed.
This abstraction enables non-local file state storage, remote execution, etc.

By default, Terraform uses the "local" backend, which is the normal behavior of Terraform you're used to.

Terraform includes the concept of a state backend, which is remote storage for Terraform state. When using a state
backend, the state file is stored in a data store such as Azure Storage.

NOTE: terraform backend cannot contain interpolations

ENCRYPTION:
By default, data stored in an Azure Blob is encrypted before being persisted to the storage infrastructure.
When Terraform needs state, it is retrieved from the backend and stored in memory on your development system.
In this configuration, state is secured in Azure Storage and not written to your local disk.

Step 1:
Run storage-account-config.sh   : source storage-account-config.sh
This would create a storage account and a blob container
